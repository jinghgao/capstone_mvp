# Mowing and Horticulture Maintenance Standards (South Zone)

This document summarizes the visual and operational criteria for mowing, trimming, and horticultural upkeep in the South Zone. It integrates performance metrics from both the Trim and Horticulture standards. All measurements follow local operational guidelines and apply to both the growing and non-growing seasons.
